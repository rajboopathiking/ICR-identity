## Introduction

Identity recognition is a critical component of many applications, from automated customer onboarding to security checks at border controls. This project aims to leverage Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) technology to automate the extraction and validation of information from identity documents.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- [Pre-trained ICR Model](https://example.com/icr_model_weights.h5)
- Sample Identity Documents (provided in `sample_documents/`)
- Sure, here's a template for a README.md file related to an "ICR Identity" project:

## Introduction

Identity recognition is a critical component of many applications, from automated customer onboarding to security checks at border controls. This project aims to leverage Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) technology to automate the extraction and validation of information from identity documents.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Sample Identity Documents (provided in `sample_documents/`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   - git clone https://github.com/your-username/icr-identity.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   - cd icr-identity

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
  - python -m venv venv
   - source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

4. Install the required dependencies:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
# Data Preparation

Prepare sample identity documents by placing them in the sample_documents/ directory. Each document should be a high-resolution image.
## ICR Model

Use the provided pre-trained ICR model to recognize characters from identity documents. Refer to icr_model_demo.ipynb notebook for a step-by-step example.
## User Interface

Implement a user interface to upload and process identity documents. Refer to the user_interface/ directory for an example web-based interface.
## Contributing

Contributions to the ICR Identity project are welcome and encouraged! If you have ideas, bug fixes, or improvements, please follow the contribution guidelines.
